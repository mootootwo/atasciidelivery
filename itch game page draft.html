<p>This is a recreation/demake of an 8-bit Atari game that I remember playing as a child.</p>
<p>I do not remember the title or publisher or anything that could help identify the original game.</p>
<p>It was not originally using character graphics or turn-based movement, and it may not have had concepts of "fuel" or "gravity" other features implemented here.&nbsp; The original game used sprites and real-time action.&nbsp; I remember being unsure if the flying saucers might not have been giant hamburgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made these design choices to cross-breed the memory of this game with roguelike design paradigms.&nbsp; Some of the features in ATASCII Delivery play with or push boundaries of typical roguelike design, specifically&nbsp;purely non-modal design which is misattributed to Rogue but is present here, and pure bump-interactions which have sometimes been misattributed to Rogue but are present here.</p>
